# MySensors-adapter

A MySensors adapter for the Mozilla WebThings Gateway.
https://github.com/mozilla-iot/gateway

It's built on top of pyMySensors by Theo Lind:
https://github.com/theolind/pymysensors

This is beta code. It currently supports most sensor inputs, as well as most actuators.

Missing or just partially implemented are:
- Thermostat/HVAC devices. The Gateway does not support them yet.
- IR sender/receiver
